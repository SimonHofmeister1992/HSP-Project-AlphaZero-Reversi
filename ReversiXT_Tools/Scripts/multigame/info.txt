before starting the multiple games (*multigame.sh):

if you don't want to start using a new model:

cp ../../../ReversiXT_Client/ReversiAlphaGo/model/bestModel.zip model/

also make the needed changes:

go to the ../../../ReversiXT_Client/ReversiAlphaGo module
copy this module to ReversiXT_Client/ReversiAlphaGo2

compile both using: mvn clean compile package

try to start the multigame-script. if you can see the game playing in the logfile
everything is fine. 

if not: kill the processes: "*multigame.sh", "server_nogl", "ReversiAlphaGo"
which you can retrieve by using ps -ef | grep <keyword-from-above>
open the pom.xml files, comment the dependencies containing the "cuda-xx.x"-keyword
move down the src directories to general/Main.java and comment the import of Cuda 
and in the main-function comment the cuda adjustment to allow multiple gpus.

recompile everything and the program should run on cpu
